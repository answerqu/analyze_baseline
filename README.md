For now baseline includes: 
1. preprocessing (drop, fillna, encoding, scaling, dummies).  

File hyperoptimisation.py contains function which finds best hyperparametres for three classifying models: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost. Idea of code was taken from this article: https://towardsdatascience.com/an-example-of-hyperparameter-optimization-on-xgboost-lightgbm-and-catboost-using-hyperopt-12bc41a271e .
