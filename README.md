# baseline
File analyze_baseline is unfinished yet, maybe it has non-readable code for someone. 
First of all this project supposed for me, but anyone can use it in his works.
####
For now baseline includes: preprocessing (drop, fillna, encoding, scaling, dummies), 
                              light model fitting for classification(lr, NB, SGD, kNN, tree, SVC, scores, GridSearch, validation curve)
File hyperoptimisation.py contains function which finds best hyperparametres for three classifying models: XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost. Code was copied from this article: https://towardsdatascience.com/an-example-of-hyperparameter-optimization-on-xgboost-lightgbm-and-catboost-using-hyperopt-12bc41a271e .
Respiratory.ipynb is a notebook file, first look on https://www.kaggle.com/vbookshelf/respiratory-sound-database kaggle competition.
