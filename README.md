# analyze_baseline
This baseline is unfinished yet, maybe it has non-readable code for someone. 
First of all this project supposed for me, but anyone can use it in his works.

For now baseline includes: preprocessing (drop, fillna, encoding, scaling, dummies), 
                              light model fitting for classification(lr, NB, SGD, kNN, tree, SVC, scores, GridSearch, validation curve)
